# Suggested actions from GPT4 for environment.py

2. Standardize Reward Signals
To standardize reward signals, you should clearly define how rewards are calculated within your environment. This involves modifying the step method to ensure that rewards are consistent and meaningful for the learning objectives.

4. Validation Methods
Implement a method within your environment to validate the actions taken by the agent. This method can be used to ensure actions comply with certain rules or constraints.
environment.py

```bash
def validate_action(self, action):
    """
    Validate the action taken by the agent.
    
    This method can be used to check if the action complies with the environment's rules.
    """
    # Example validation
    if not self.action_space.contains(action):
        raise ValueError("Action is not valid in the current action space.")
```

5. Custom Wrapper or Interface
Create a custom wrapper or interface for agents that interact with your environment. This wrapper can enforce checks on the agent's policy and value functions.

```bash
class AgentInterface:
    """
    A custom interface or wrapper for agents interacting with the environment.
    This can enforce certain checks or requirements on the agent's policy and value functions.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, agent, environment):
        self.agent = agent
        self.environment = environment
    
    def check_compliance(self):
        """
        Implement checks to ensure the agent's policy and value functions are compliant.
        """
        # Example check
        if not hasattr(self.agent, 'policy'):
            raise AttributeError("Agent must have a policy attribute.")
        # Add more checks as needed
    
    def run_episode(self):
        """
        Run an episode with the agent, using the environment.
        """
        self.check_compliance()
        state = self.environment.reset()
        done = False
        while not done:
            action = self.agent.policy(state)
            state, reward, done, info = self.environment.step(action)
```
