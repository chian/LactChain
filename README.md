# LactChain: Language Action Chain Reinforcement Learning

This repo serves as a template for coding out a Reinforcement Learning (RL) system. This system is meant to be a multi-purpose system with multiple possible applications.

## TODOs:

Add things needed to enforce structure of any subsequent code
1. Make generic baseclass for actor (policy) network
2. Make generic baseclass for critic (value) network
3. Make generic baseclass for reward function
4. Write unit tests

Build out specific use cases
1. Draw schematic of simple use case
2. Add plausibly useful language action chains using lactchain class
3. Add code extractor (from gpt4 output) and other functions in state class
4. Define example format for textblock in state class
5. Define Policy and Value Function networks
6.
